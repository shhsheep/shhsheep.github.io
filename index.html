<h1>AIAJ</h1>
<p class="wrap">Bushy, a red squirrel, is taking a science class the following year. Her summer assignment is to write a short, eye-opening report that introduces a living thing in her neighborhood. The topic she decided to write about—algae—is based on the green mass in a nearby pond. From the assignment, she discovers their ecological importance and their many applications in daily life. Excited to share her research, Bushy opens her room to interested squirrels. </p>
